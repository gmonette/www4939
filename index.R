# TODO:
# 
# - Frist: possible ask list of questions for different students to answer
#   based on vocabular study.
#   Idea; Different students use same methodology so those lacking will
#   get help from others.
# 
# - look at notes in Quire for changes to description, e.g.
#   - require cameras for oral test
#   - in class 1 hour midterm and 2 hour final if inclass possible, otherwise
#     a 30 minute oral individually scheduled for both
#   - weekly quiz, in class on laptop with access to web to equalize
#     for students not in class
#   - sould I change to markdown to facilitate citations:
#   - add reading and sumarizzing a paper
#   - add contributed links should be accompanied with a note describing
#     why the link is interesting and providing a critique.
#   - front row team as before, your participation is much appreciated
#     and makes a big difference to the lecturer.
#   - Lescture will be on zomm. Class attendance is expected and participation
#     in class or via chat, etc, which students can use in class also is encouraged
#   - make sure speakers not active on your lapttop if you use zoom in class;
#     a good trick is to plug earbuds in your laptop to avoid deafening feedback
#     loops
#   - Team Project: differen students work on different aspects of a problem
#     and then combine their work into a common project and presentation to
#     be recorded on Zoom and will be posted for class.
#   - Two Other teams comment independently??
# What do do about SAS. Might have time this year due to early start.

##' ### __Assignment 2__ (individual): Setting things up
#' 
#' __Due Sunday, January 14, 9 pm__
#' 
#' - __Summary:__ 
#'     1. Install (or update) R and RStudio
#'     2. Get a free Github account 
#'     3. Install git on your computer
#'     4. Post publicly on Piazza if you run into problems.  Help others if you can. Before the deadline on Sunday, 
#'        post at least one public message commenting on your experiences installing software. Use the folder 'assn2'. 
#' - __1. Install R and RStudio__ following
#'   [these instructions](files/software_installation.html). If you have already installed R and RStudio, update them to the latest versions.
#' - __2. Get a free Github account:__ If you don't have one, first consider choosing a name. Here's
#'   [an excellent source of advice from Jenny Bryan](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html).
#'     - __CAUTION:__ Avoid installing 'Github for Windows'  from the Github site. It is not
#'       the same as 'Git for Windows'.
#' - __3. Install git on your computer__ using the instructions on [Jenny Bryan's webpage](https://happygitwithr.com/).
#'     - If you are curious about how git is used have a look at [this tutorial](https://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1597:_Git)! 
#'     - As a final step: In the RStudio menu click on `Tools | Global Options ... | Terminal`. Then click on the box in 
#'       __Shell__ paragraph to the right of _New terminals open with:_ 
#'         - On a PC, select _Git Bash_    
#'         - On a Mac, select _Bash_    
#'     - You don't need to do anything else at this time. We will see how to set up SSH keys to connect to Github 
#'       <!-- and to blackwell -->
#'       through the RStudio terminal in a few lectures.
#' - __4. Post questions on Piazza__ and if everything goes well, post that on Piazza. Use the folder 'assn2'.

#' __Learning R:__
#' 
#' Why R? What about SAS, SPSS, Python, among others?
#' 
#' SAS is a very high quality, intensely engineered,
#' environment for statistical analysis. It is widely used
#' by large corporations.  New procedures in SAS are
#' developed and thoroughly tested by a team of 1,000 or more
#' SAS engineers before being released. It currently
#' has more than 300 procedures.
#' 
#' R is an environment for statistical programming 
#' and development
#' that has accumulated many somewhat inconsistent 
#' layers developed
#' over time by people of varying abilities, many
#' of whom work
#' largely independently of each other.
#' There is no centralized
#' quality testing except to check whether code 
#' and documentation run
#' before a new package is added to R's main repository,
#' CRAN. 
#' When this page was last updated, CRAN had `r format(nrow(available.packages()), big.mark = ',')` packages.
#' 
#' In addition, a large number of packages under development are available through
#' other repositories, such as github.
#' 
#' The development of SAS began in 1966 and that of R
#' (in the form of its predecessor, S, at Bell Labs) in 1976.
#' 
#' The 'design' of R (using 'R' to refer to both R and
#' to S) owes a lot to the design of Unix. 
#' The idea is to create
#' a toolbox of simple tools that you link together yourself 
#' to perform an analysis.  Unix, 
#' [now mainly as Linux](https://opensource.com/article/18/5/differences-between-linux-and-unix),
#' ^[R is to S as Linux is to Unix as GNU C is to C as GNU C++ is to C .... S, Unix, C and C++ were created at Bell Labs in the late 60s and the 70s. R, Linux, GNU C and GNU C++ are public license re-engineerings of the proprietary S, Unix, C and C++ respectively.]
#' commands were
#' simple tools linked together by _pipes_ so the output
#' of one command is the input of the next. To do anything
#' you need to put the commands together yourself.
#' 
#' The same is true of R. It's extremely flexible but at
#' the cost of requiring you to know what you want to do
#' and to be able to use its many tools in combination with each other
#' to achieve your goal. Many decisions in R's design were intended
#' to make it easy to use interactively.  Often the result is a
#' language that is very quirky for programming.
#' 
#' SAS, in contrast, requires you to select options
#' to run large procedures that purport to do the entire job. 
#' 
#' This is an old joke: If someone publishes a journal
#' article about a new statistical
#' method, it might be added to SAS in 5 to 10 years. 
#' It won't be added to SPSS until 5 years after there's 
#' a textbook written 
#' about it, maybe another 10 to 15 years after its appearance in SAS. 
#' 
#' It was added to R two years ago because the new method 
#' was developed as a package in R long before being published. 
#' 
#' So why become a statistician? So you can have the breadth
#' and depth of understanding that someone needs to apply 
#' the latest statistical ideas with the intelligence
#' and discernment to use them effectively. 
#' 
#' So expect to have a symbiotic relationship with R.
#' You need R to have access to the tools that
#' implement the latest ideas in
#' statistics. R needs you because it takes people 
#' like you to use R effectively.
#' 
#' The role of R in this course is to help us
#' 
#' - have access to tools to expand our ability to explore and analyze data, and
#' - learn how to develop and implement new statistical methods.
#'   i.e. learn how to build new tools
#' - deepen our understanding of the use of statistics
#'   for scientific discovery as well as for business applications
#' 
#' It's very challenging to find a good way to
#' 'learn R'.  It depend on where you are and where
#' you want to go. Now, there's a plethora of on-line
#' courses. See the blog post:
#' [The 5 Most Effective Ways to Learn R](https://www.r-bloggers.com/the-5-most-effective-ways-to-learn-r/) 
#' 
#' In my opinion, ultimately, the best way is to 
#' 
#' - __play__ your way through the 'official' 
#'   [manuals on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) 
#'   starting with 'An Introduction to R' along with
#'   'R Data Import/Export'. Note however that these materials
#'   were developed before the current mounting concern
#'   with reproducible research and some of the advice
#'   should be deprecated, e.g. using 'attach' and
#'   'detach' with data.frames.
#' - read the 
#'   [CRAN task views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views) 
#'   in areas that interest you.
#' - Have a look at the 1/2 million questions tagged 'r' on
#'   [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r?tab=newest&page=1&pagesize=15). 
#' - At every opportunity, use R Markdown documents (like the sample script you
#'   ran when you installed R) to work on assignments, project, 
#'   etc.
#'    
#' Using R is like playing the piano. You can read and learn
#' all the theory you want, ultimately you learn by __playing__.
#'
#' Copy the following scripts as files in RStudio:
#' 
#' - Elementary examples in R: [CAR_1.R](files/R/CAR_1.R), and
#' - More advanced techniques: [Working with Data.R](files/R/Working_with_Data.R). 
#' 
#' __Play__ with them line by line. 
#' 
#' Post questions arising from these scripts to the 'question' folder 
#' on Piazza.  We will take up some questions in class and others
#' in tutorials scheduled to deal with questions on R.   
#'
