## Installing spida2 and p3d --------------------------------------------

# If you use a PC you may need to install Rtools. Instructions are
#   shown on the main page with instructions for installing R
# You may need to install the following packages:
# install.packages(c('car','rgl', 'Hmisc','devtools'))
# to install 'spida2' and 'p3d'
# library(devtools)
# install_github('gmonette/spida2')
# install_github('gmonette/p3d')


## Introduction to Lab 1  

# 
# At first, it's easier to learn by following a 'textbook' example where nothing 
# goes wrong. However, when you analyze real data lots of things tend to go wrong
# -- or, more positively, many interesting things happen -- and you wish you
# had experience with more realistic examples. These examples try to do both.
# 
# The first example is a gentle analysis in which we use the basic ideas of
# multilevel models with mixed models.  We learn how to formulate and test
# general linear hypotheses that allow us to ask a much wider range of questions
# than those accessible through standard output.
# 
# The second example, using a different model with the same data, illustrates
# what to do when 'everything' goes wrong, oops, I meant "when a lot of
# interesting things happen."
# 
# In the second example, the first model does not converge and we have to figure
# out what to do. We need to test random effects variance parameters that are
# not tested validly with the usual methods and we learn how to use simulation
# for this purpose.
# 
# Our analysis of BLUPS reveals problems with the model whose correction we
# consider.
# 
# The second sample analysis is quite long but it is amply annotated
# so that you can follow much of it on your own.

##  Data: Math Achievement and SES -----------------------------------

#
#  Math Achievement and SES in a sample of Public and Catholic high schools
#
#  Goal: Study the relationship between SES and Mathach in Public vs
#  Catholic schools
#

### Exploring data ---------------------------------------------------  

library( spida2 )  
# For use with mixed models you also need to load the package
# you will be using to fit mixed models, typically 
# nlme or lme4
#
# Here, we're using nlme
#
library(nlme) 
library(car)
library(lattice)
library( p3d )   # in case we want to see things in 3d

?hsfull
dim( hsfull )
some( hsfull )   # a random selection of rows


# A 'uniform quantile' plot. Data is lined up from shortest to tallest.

xqplot( hsfull )  # gives an idea of distribution, outliers, granularity, etc. at a glance

# A 'normal quantile' plot. Data is lined up from shortest to tallest, x-axis stretched
# to have shape of ideal normal.  If a variable is close to normal, its quantile
# plot will be close to a diagonal

xqplot( hsfull , ptype='normal') # normal quantiles on x-axis

## Data: Levels and structure --------------------------------------------

##
## Data structures, part 1: moving up one level
##

# 'hsfull' has one student per row. 
# It is a **long** file combining variables of all levels.
# If we want information on schools, we can create a data set that has one row
# per school, keeping only those variable that are invariant within schools, i.e.
# Level 2 variables

hsup <- up( hsfull, ~ school )  # one row per school with Level 2 variables 
some( hsup )
dim( hsup )

# Levels of variables in hsfull
# 'Generalized intraclass correlation'
#  Intraclass correlation using ranks
gicc( hsfull, ~ school )

Tab( hs, ~ school)         # school size: 'Tab' is a variant of 'tab' with no totals
tab( Tab( hs, ~ school ))  # schools by school size
xqplot( hsup )

# To speed things up in the lab, we will use a (pre-)randomly selected half of the
# schools. This will allow you to have the sobering experience of
# of split sample validation!

'

== Selecting a random subset of clusters ==
'
# 
# Randomly selecting a subset of clusters
# 
# We can't randomly sample from the long file
# if we want each cluster (school)to be either all in or all out.
# 
# There are a few ways of selecting all the observations from a
# sample of clusters. The following seems fairly intuitive.
# 
# We first create the school level file and take a sample
# of school from that file. We then merge the sample file with
# the longfile. Merge will match with variables that have the same name.
# By default, it only uses records that match in both files, so it
# produces the result we want.


hsup <- up ( hsfull, ~ school)  # as above
dim(hsup)                       # one row per school

#
# For speed we'll use a randomly selected subset of half the schools
# This has another interesting consequence: we can do a split-half
# analysis in which the model developed on one half of the clusters
# is validated with the other half
#  #  The following code shows how to split the clusters into two halves
#  although we'll be using two 'preselected' halves
#

selected <- sample( 1:nrow( hsup ) , round( nrow( hsup )/2 )) # row indices
# for half the schools
hsu1 <- hsup[ selected, ]      # first half of schools
hsu2 <- hsup[ - selected, ]    # other half

hs1 <- merge( hsu1, hsfull )    # long data for 1st half of schools
hs2 <- merge( hsu2, hsfull )    # long data for other half

dim(hs1)
dim(hs2)

# But we will use a preselected hs1
search()
rm( hs1 )  # removes hs1 from GlobalEnv

hs1    # sees 'hs1' from spida2 package

#
# or
# hs1 <- read.csv("http://www.math.yorku.ca/~georges/Data/hs1.csv")
# to illustrate that you can use any .csv file not just files that are
# prepackaged in a package
#

dd <- hs1              # easier to type repeatedly

dim( dd )
some(dd)

#
#
# QUESTION:
#    What to look for: What stands out in 'between-school' relationships?
#    Classify variables:
#         - Level 1 variables
#         - Level 2 variables: natural (properties of cluster)
#                and derived [or 'contextual'] (properties of the sample).
#    Does this suggest any multilevel questions?
#    Are there derived level 2 (contextual) variables that could be relevant?

#
# Creating additional Level 2 ( and Level 1 ) variables with 'capply'
#

#
# An important part of modeling is being able to easily create the variables
# that capture the phenomena you want to study. Frequently, these variables
# are not in the raw data set.
#


# Examples:

#  Sample size:
#  capply( y, cluster, fun)  
#
#     1. divides 'y' into chunks for each value of the argument 'cluster'
#
#     2. applies the function 'fun' to each chunk
#
#     3a. if 'fun' returns a vector of the same length as the chunk of 'y'
#         then 'capply' returns that vector in the position of 'y'
#     
#     3b. if 'fun' returns a single value, that value gets returned in
#         every position of 'y'
#         

dd$n <- capply( dd$school, dd$school, length)
some( dd )
head( dd )  # to see that new variable is constant in first school


# mean ses by school (contextual ses)

dd$ses.m <- with( dd, capply( ses, school, mean, na.rm = TRUE ))
head( dd )

# ses centered within school (CWG = centered with groups)
# This is the deviation of a student from the mean of the 
# sample in her school

dd$ses.cwg <- dd$ses - dd$ses.m
head( dd )

# ses heterogeneity as measured by the IQR within schools

dd$ses.iqr <- capply( dd$ses, dd$school,
                      function ( x ) {
                        qs <- quantile(x, c(25,75)/100)
                        qs[2] - qs[1]
                      }
)

# Note: There is an "IQR" function to compute the inter-quartile range
#       but I wanted to do it from scratch to illustrate the use of
#       an 'anonymous' function, i.e. a function defined on the fly.
# We could have done:

dd$ses.iqr <- capply( dd$ses, dd$school, IQR, na.rm = FALSE)

# but we could modify the anomymous function it to 


dd$ses.trange <- capply( dd$ses, dd$school,  # where 'trange' stands for 'truncated range'
                         function ( x ) {
                           qs <- quantile(x, c(10,90)/100, na.rm = FALSE)
                           qs[2] - qs[1]
                         }
)

# consider variations like

dd$ses.sd <- capply( dd$ses, dd$school, sd, na.rm = FALSE)

some( dd )
head( dd )


'
=== Tranformations of Level 1 variables within groups ===
'

# capply will also create a Level 1 variable if the FUN returns a
# a vector of length greater than 1. The vector gets recycled to match
# the length of the argument, i.e. the number of the rows corresponding
# to a particular id.
#
# The following example shows the calculation of ses rank within schools:
#

dd$ses.rank <- capply( dd$ses, dd$school, rank , na.last = 'keep' )
some( dd )
head( dd )

# Using the rank instead of the raw value
# could be useful for highly skewed variables where you don't
# want extreme values to have too much influence

# The following example shows the use of 'capply' to compute a value
# that depends on more than one variable in the data frame. If the first
# argument is a data frame, then 'capply' splits the data frame into
# data frames with just the rows belonging to each id. Using the 'with' function
# on these data frames allows you to write an expression as the
# fourth argument which becomes the second argument of with.
#
# ses discrepancy of Minority in school (requires more than one variable)

dd$minority.diff <- capply( dd, ~ school, with,
                            mean( ses[ Minority == "Yes" ] , na.rm = T) -
                              mean( ses[ Minority == "No" ] , na.rm = T) )
# Beware: this way of using 'capply' can be slow with very large files
# like the NPHS long file.

== Looking at Level 1 and Level 2 data using Lattice graphics ==

'

#
#  Preparing for multilevel modelling:
#        Visualizing data at Level 1 and Level 2
#
#
#  From the mixed model to the hierarchical models:
#
#  With software like HLM, MlWin, you need to use separate data sets for
#  the different levels. With nlme and SAS PROC MIXED, we use combined long
#  data set with all the variables together.
#
#  We first need to separate the Levels of the model.
#
#
#   1) Level 1 model:
#
#      mathach ~ 1 + ses | school
#
#   2) Level 2 model:
#
#           Using coefficients of Level 1 Model:
#                 B.0   ~ 1 + Sector
#                 B.ses ~ 1 + Sector
#
#           Combining with Level 1:
#
#               ~     1 * ( 1 + Sector )
#                 + ses * ( 1 + Sector )
#
#
#   3) Mixed model: Simplify combined model
#
#      mathach ~ 1 + ses + Sector + ses:Sector
#
#      OR (using Rs rules for generating marginal effects)
#
#      mathach ~ ses * Sector
#
#
#   4) Random effects model:
#
#          ~ 1 + ses | id     # usually contained in Level 1 model
#
#           Often, a simpler model is used, e.g. ~ 1 | id
#
#   5) Contextual variable:
#
#      Mean ses | school  i.e cvar( ses , school)
#
#      Mixed model with contextual variable:
#
#      mathach ~ 1 + ses + Sector + ses:Sector + cvar( ses, school) + ...

# range of assumptions than deleting clusters -- as one
# would have to do with a repeated measures analysis.
# More on this in Lab 4.R

# Syntax

fit <- lme( mathach ~ ses * Sector, dd, random = ~ 1 + ses | id,
            na.action = na.exclude,
            control = list(msMaxIter=200, msVerbose=T))


#
# Note: generally 'na.exclude' is preferable to 'na.omit'
# It allows residuals and predicted values to match the original
# data frame, not just the observations that were not missing.
#

#
#  In passing: What to do if the model does not converge
#

#  We will revisit this when we need it:
#
#  Summary:
#  1) If Iteration limit reached: Increase iterations.
#
#     ?lmeControl
#     lmeControl
#
#     fit <- lme( mathach ~ ses * Sector, dd, random = ~ 1 + ses | id,

#                   msVerbose = TRUE , returnObject = TRUE ))
#     summary( fit )
#
#
#  2) If singular convergence, the frequent cause is that the
#     random model is more complex than necessary. I.e. the variability
#     from cluster to cluster that you are trying to account for with
#     the random part of the model is actually accounted for by the
#     'epsilons', the within-cluster variability. Consequently a
#     variance is estimated to be 0 or the G matris is non-singular,
#     i.e. it's a flat pancake.
#
#     It could be a flat pancake because of scaling OR centering.
#
#     Try:
#     1) Global center x in RE model (not necessarily at the mean but
#        that's a good first try. The 'ideal' place is the point of
#        minimum variance of the response. Plot OLS lines to get an idea.
#
#     2) Also try centering within clusters (CWC or CWG). The RE model
#        is not equivalent but it could often be better depending on
#        the process. Use AIC to compare.,
#
#     3) If neither works, start with simple RE model and add components
#        using a forward stepwise approach. Use 'anova' and 'simulate'
#        to test additional components.  If a model does not converge,
#        use
#             ..., control = (...., returnObject = TRUE, msVerbose = TRUE)
#        to judge whether the likelihood ratio converges even though the
#        parameters don't. In this case, anova can give a usable p-value
#        that can be adjusted with 'simulate'.
#
#     fit.big <- lme( ...., control = list( maxIter = 200,
#                    msMaxIter = 200, niterEM = 100,
#                   msVerbose = TRUE , returnObject = TRUE ))
#     anova ( fit.simple, fit.big )
#     zsim <- simulate( fit.simple, nsim = 1000, m2 = fit.big)
#     plot( zsim )
#
#        to test whether 'fit.simple' is adequate.
#
#     Handling non-convergence is discussed in greater detail in
#     Lab Session 3

#   Historically: Is the mixed model correctly estimating the effect of ses
#   But in fact:
#       Do we need a contextual variable? i.e.
#       Is the between-school effect of ses not significantly different
#          from the within-school effect of ses
#   If so, then we should include a separate effect for the between-school
#   effect of ses and we will be able to estimate the within school effect
#   correctly.
#


# Model with contextual variable for ses, i.e. each school's mean ses:
# Note: we can use the cvar function for convenience or we can
# create a variable in the data frame, i.e. ses.m above.
# We will use cvar because it's always easy to use even if the
# variable has not been defined.
#
# Moreover, cvar works correctly with factors generating mean
# values of indicators for each level of the factor omitting the
# reference level. We will illustrate this later.

#
#  Role of the contextual variable for ses
#

#
#     Including cvar(ses, id) has two important consequences:
#
#     1) It unbiases the estimated effect of ses so it estimates
#        the WITHIN-SCHOOL effect of ses unbiased by the between
#        school effect of ses
#
#     2) It provides an estimate of the 'contextual effect' of ses
#        and of
#        the BETWEEN-SCHOOL (= compositional) effect of ses which
#        is equal to the sum of the contextual and the within-effect
#

#
# Interpreting the model with contextual effect
#

wald( fitc )

#
#  The coefficient for cvar(ses,id) is very significant
#  Interpretation:
#
#  Coefficients of ...   (in this model):
#
#     ses                within-school effect of ses (not contaminated
#                        by between school effect)
#
#     cvar( ses, id )    Contextual effect of ses:
#                        between school effect of ses KEEPING
#                        individual ses constant. I.E. Compare two
#                        students with the same ses but in two
#                        schools where the mean ses is one unit apart
#
#     SectorPublic       difference from Catholic to Public sector
#                        when student ses = 0. Note: in this model
#                        cvar( ses, id) enters additively so it doesn't
#                        change this effect. It DOES matter in the sense
#                        that estimated difference is in the within-school
#                        effect of ses, not a combination of within and
#                        between.

#     ses:SectorPublic   Difference in effect of ses from Catholic to

#   Note:
#     Compositional effect of ses = Within-school effect +
#                                        Contextual effect
#
#     This is e.g. the difference going from a student with ses = X in

# Plotting error bars

# The data frame created by wald includes the information necessary to
# plot error bounds on the predicted lines
#
# The 'panel function' panel.fit will produce the error bars.
# The easiest way to use it is with 'layers' provided by
# the 'latticeExtra' package, which you might need to install from CRAN
#
# In the call to xyplot, provide arguments for the following
# parameters:
#   fit: the fitted value for which a line or curve will be plotted
#   upper: the upper boundary of the error bar
#   lower: the lower boundary
#   subscripts = T (so xyplot will pass the necessary information to 
#                    the panel function)
#
# Then you need to add a '+' at the end of the 'xyplot' command and
# follow that with:
#    layer(panel.fit(...))   if you did not use groups, and
#    glayer(panel.fit(...))  if you did use groups

#
#   Notes on testing: ML vs REML
#

# The default for lme is fitting with 'Residual Maximum Likelihood' (REML)
# -- it has other interpretations but everyone agrees on 'REML' --
# With REML, maximum likelihood is applied ONLY to the parameters for
# random effects, i.e. the G matrix and sigma (or R). The Betas play
# no direct role, they are only estimated with Generalized Least Squares
# as an afterthought.  This means that the likelihood with REML is only
# informative for the the RE model: the G and R matrices. You can't
# compare two models that have different FE models.
#
# Full maximum likelihood (ML) does look at Betas, G and R together. So the
# likelihood with ML can be used to test two models with different Betas.
#
# The consequence is that:
#
# If two models have been fitted with REML, the must have identical FE models
# to compare them with 'anova': p-values, AIC, BIC.
#
# If two models have been fitted with ML, you can use 'anova' regardless
# of the FE or the RE models --- PROVIDED they have the same response variable
#
# Wald tests can be used for both ML or REML fits. They might be more accurate
# with REML fits. However, Wald test tend to useful mainly for the FE part of
# the model. 'wald' in 'spida2' only works for the FE model.
# To compare two RE models (with identical FE models) LRT is generally better
# than Wald. However, classic p-values tend to be too large in many cases
# and should be adjusted through simulation.
#
# Summary:
#    wald is ok for the FE model whether ML or REML
#    anova (with simulation adjustment) is ok for the RE model
#              provided the FE models are identical
#    anova can be used to test different FE models or
#              models that differ in both FEs and REs
#              ONLY IF THE MODELS ARE fitted with ML.

# Answer: at end of script.
#
# With MM residuals:
#
# Why are residuals not uncorrelated with predicted values ( a canon of OLS )?
#
# Reason: if we were using OLS on the pooled data, resids would be uncorrelated.
#
# But MMs is roughly like doing OLS on pooled data,
# then adding an additional fit at the cluster level.
#
# If unaccounted between cluster effects are in the same
# direction as within cluster effect then higher residuals with higher fitted values
# will get a second fit, This shrinks the high positive OLS residuals and
# stretches the corresponding fitted values creating a negative slope

#
# In the Catholic Sector: (because SectorPublic = 0)
#
#    E(mathach) = b0 + b.ses x ses
#                    +  b.ses.m x ses.m

#
#    E(mathach) = b0 + b.ses x ses +b.SectorPublic x 1
#                    +  b.ses.m x ses.m + b.int x ses x 1
#    gathering terms:
#               =  (b0 + b.SectorPublic)
#                  +(b.ses + b.int) x ses
#                    +  b.ses.m x ses.m
#
#    so the intercept is b0 + b.SectorPublic
#    and the slope wrt ses is b.ses + b.int

# This should help in formulating various questions in terms of

== Exercises ==

#
#  EXERCISES:
#

# Choose the problem that seems most appropriate:
#
# 1)  Add the variable 'Sex' to analysis above. Note that Sex has
#     a contextual variable: Sex composition, a variable with
#     interestingly different features in Catholic vs Public school.
#
#     If you wish to gain some experience with convergence problems
#     use the full Level 1 model ( ~ ses*Sex | id ) for your RE model.
#     If this fails to converge, try to use the advice given above to
#     correct the problem. If you prefer not to bother for now,
#     just use the additive model:
#
#             random =   ~1 + ses + Sector |id
#
#     Try to estimate the Gender Gap under various circumstances:
#     ses and Sector if the effect of Sex interacts with these variables.
#
#     Which circumstances are associated with large gender gaps,
#     with small gender gaps?
#
#     Make graphs of the gender gap as a function of its moderators,
#     preferably with confidence bounds.
#
# 2)  Analyze the data in 'bdf' in 'nlme':
#     > data (bdf)
#     > ?bdf
#     on Language Scores of 8-Graders in The Netherlands
#
#     This is similar to the 'hs' dataset but different enough
#     to be interesting.
#
#     The response of interest is 'langPOST' a measure of language
#     achievement at the end of the school year.
#
#     Potential predictors include: ses, sex, denominat (Sector),
#     Minority, IQ.verb as well as a pretest: langPRE.
#
#     This raises the interesting question of the best use for the
#     pretest. Should it be used as a covariate or should you analyze
#     the gain score: langPOST - langPRE as the response.
#
#     As usual, the best course of action may depend on the questions
#     and intended interpretation of the results.
#
# 3)  Study the role of 'Minority' in the 'hs' data following the
#     script below
#
# 4)  Validate the model above with the other half of the data 'hs2'
#     What differences do you note?

# Fit the Level 1 OLS model (fixed-effects model in the sense of Econonometrics:
#
# -- Use only the Level 1 model with an interaction with the cluster factor
# -- This fits an OLS model in each cluster
# -- The within-cluster model might not be estimable in some clusters (indeed in any!)

# we could reshape coef(fit) in a data frame with one column
# for each coefficient but it's more natural to use the
# built-in lmList function -- although it presents a few problems

# Using lmList: fits an OLS model in each cluster
#
# Steps:
# 1) Work out the Level 1 model using only Level 1 variables

mathach ~ ses * Minority

# 2) select only the variables you need (otherwise lmList drops rows with NAs even

## Check scaling of Level 1 variables within clusters:
##

fit.scale <- lm( cbind( Minority, ses) ~ factor(school), dd)
plot( resid(fit.scale))
var( resid( fit.scale ))   # sds are not too far apart ( within factor of 10 ok?)

##
##  Summary: it's useful to examine the data at level 1 but the influence of
##  points in the Level 1 model is not that directly relatied to their influence
##  in the mixed model because the presence of points with very high leverage
##  at Level 1 is associated with a low weight for the cluster in the mixed model.

# 'singular convergence' means that the log-likelihood is so flat

# The algorithm does not work with the variance itself but with
# the log of the variance.  As the variance gets close to 0,

#               IF the test does not reject, use simulation to calibrate the p-value

#   2)  We can't use Wald tests because the log-likelihood is just too far from

=== Dos, don'ts and whys ===
" 

#
# Simplifying the model -- different approaches:
#
# 1) BAD:  drop all terms with big p-values.
#    Why bad? I) resulting model might violate principle of marginality
#             II) 2 or more terms might all have large p-values, yet
#                 jointly they could be highly significant
#             III) data-driven, ignores background theory and interpretability
#                 of the model.
#
# 2) STILL BAD: drop one term at a time with big p-values then refit:
#    Why bad? I and III
#
# 3) Drop "non-marginal" terms one at a time.
#    Getting better. Still a problem with III
#
# 4) Test whether you can drop "non-marginal" groups of terms (of 1 or more)
#    that have a theoretical meaning:
#
#    a) from the top: start with highest order interactions and move down,
#             e.g. test 4-way interactions, drop if not significant,
#                  then test 3-way, etc.
#
#    b) from the side: test whether you can drop all terms or all interactions
#       that involve a particular term.
#
#  Note that in 4, at each step, you are comparing two models:
#  the 'full' current model at each stage and a candidate smaller model.
#  In this comparison, the candidate model is the H0 model and the
#  current model is the alternative Ha model.
#
#  We illustrate 4(a) and (b). This approach can be laborious but is easy
#  with Wald tests:

'
=== Wald or Likelihood Ratio Test ===
'

#  Technical note: An interesting trade-off:
#
#  We could use Wald tests [wald(...)] or LRTs [anova(fit1,fit2)] for to test
#  a hypothesis with multiple terms.
#  Generally, where feasible, LRT is considered better than Wald.
#
#  However to test fixed effects in a mixed model, we need to fit with
#  method = "ML" instead of method = "REML" (the default for 'lme')
#  and REML is considered better than ML.
#
#  So we have a choice of the LRT approach:
#
#  1) - LRT: refit the current (Ha) model with method = 'ML' - call it fit.Ha
#     - write and fit the smaller model with method = 'ML' - call it fit.H0
#     - compare the two models with 'anova( fit.H0, fit.Ha )'
#
#  2) - Wald: Use the REML model and use 'wald( fit.HA, pattern )' to test
#       the hypothesis that the coefficients that are candidates for
#       dropping could all be simultaneously 0.
#
#  Note that it is generally preferable to use 'wald' on a REML fit than
#  on a ML fit.  'anova' can only be used on a ML fit.
#
#

#  In the following, we use Wald. Using LRT is presented as an exercise
#  We illustrate approaches 4a and 4b:

# OUR GOAL: Make the model as simple as possible but not too simple (Einstein)
# Metagoal: Figure out what our goal means.

#
# The minority-majority gap
#

# We could put some se lines around the fitted lines but these might not
# be as useful as in the case of lm or glm fits. The reason is that se lines
# around fitted lines bear a predictable relationshiop to the evidence for
# the difference of the two lines in the case of lm or glm fits.
#
# In the case of mixed models, the significance of the difference is not
# necessarily related to the se lines around the predicted value.  It is
# possible for se-intervals to have a large overlap although the DIFFERENCE
# of the two lines is highly significant.  This is because the se-lines
# reflect the variability of each line in the population. If the contrast
# between the two lines is a within-cluster contrast, then it might be
# estimated with high precision although each line has very large variability.
#
# We could construct an L matrix by hand to estimate the gap at many values of
# ses and then use the estimated value and its ses to construct the
# predicted value +/- 2 ses. Some functions are designed to make this easier
# by creating a matrix whose elements are evaluated on a data frame.
#
# We only need ses so let's generate a range:

dgap <- expand.grid( ses = seq(-2,2,.1))
some( dgap )

# note that a row of the L matrix to estimate the gap has the form:
#   c( 0, 0, 1, 0, ses)

##  Exercises

#
#  1) As we saw, 'Sector' appears to be an important predictor.
#     Consider models using ses and Sector.
#     Aim to estimate the between Sector gap as a function of ses
#     if there is an interaction between Sector and ses
#     Check for and provide for a possible contextual effect of ses.
#     Plot expected math achievement in each sector.
#     Plot the gap with SEs.
#     Consider the possibility that the apparently flatter effect of
#     ses in Catholic school could be due to a non-linear effect of ses.
#     How would you test whether this is a reasonable alternative
#     explanation?
#
#  2) Take the example further by incorporation Sex. Consider the
#     the 'contextual effect' of Sex which is school sex composition.
#     Note that there are three types of schools: Girls, Boys and Coed
#     schools. If you consider an interaction between Sector and
#     school gender composition, you will see that the Public Sector
#     only has Coed schools.

# The following is equivalent to Hausman's test in economics
# The idea is to test whether the between school effect is the
# same as the within-school (the difference between the two
# is the contextual effect). If not the mixed model will give a
# biased estimate of the within school effect and the Hausman test
# was used to decide between using a mixed model or a fixed effects model.
#
# Now we know better.
#
# We can achieve the same thing -- and more -- by simply including the
# contextual variable in the mixed model.
#
# So Hausman's test has been turned into a modelling decision.
#
# It was used to decide whether to fit a mixed model or a
# fixed effects model since the former, if there is a contextual effect,
# will yield biased estimates of the within group
