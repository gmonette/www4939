#'
#' # Goals of MATH 4939
#' 
#' MATH 4939 is a fourth-year capstone course. You have already taken a number of statistics courses that focus on diverse methodologies 
#' that are applied to problems and data suited to the specific methodology of each course.
#'
#' The fundamental purpose of MATH 4939 is to bring together all that you have previously learned in statistics to provide you 
#' with the skills to apply this knowledge effectively, imaginatively, creatively and correctly to the task of addressing real scientific 
#' or business questions with real data.
#' 
#' When you successfully complete this course you should have improved your ability to:
#' 
#' - describe the factors that differentiate between observational and experimental data and know what questions to ask to identify the kind
#'   of data you are working with correctly,
#' - differentiate among different types of scientific and business questions: predictive, causal/explanatory and descriptive questions,
#' - identify the distinct roles of explanatory variables and relate them to their positions in causal graphs, 
#' - adapt model building strategies and model evaluation strategies appropriately for the type of scientific or business question, 
#'   the type of data being analyzed, and the roles of available variables,
#' - be able to express limitations in the interpretation of results due to the design of a study, possible omitted variables, 
#'   incorrect model specification, incorrectly included variables that
#'   may bias model interpretation, incorrect data, etc.,
#' - know what questions to ask to identify the presence and nature of missing data, including data whose missingness 
#'   is not apparent by merely inspecting a data set,
#' - apply basic strategies to deal with missing data,
#' - identify common statistical fallacies you may have acquired that arise from 
#'   generalizing principles that appear reasonable in the context of simple 
#'   linear additive problems commonly used in introductory courses but that lead 
#'   to consequential errors when applied to complex data analysed with the goal 
#'   of addressing real scientific questions,
#' - learn techniques and computer coding to visualize data and 
#'   to visualize statistical inferences and 
#'   to apply them appropriately in the analysis and reporting of conclusions,
#' - learn the theory and application of hierarchical models that allow a synthesis 
#'   of methodologies learned in previous courses so they can be applied 
#'   in a common modelling strategy,
#' - communicate statistical analyses and findings in a manner 
#'   that is appropriate for different audiences.
#' 
#' # Course work and grades
#'
#' - __Quizzes: 10%__ 
#'   - Bi-weekly 10-minute quizzes every second Wednesday starting on January 17. 
#'   - If you can't attend a quiz for medical or other reasons beyond your control, 
#'     the weight of the quiz will be transferred to the
#'     final exam.
#' - __Mid-term test: 20%__
#'   - In-class closed-book 50-minute midterm on Wednesday, February 14. 
#'     There will be no quiz on this date.  
#'     <!--- On Feb. 28 for 2131 ---> 
#'   - If you can't write the midterm for medical or other  
#'     reasons beyond your control, the weight of the midterm is transferred to the final exam.
#' - __Final exam: 25%__ Written closed-book 2-hour exam during the regular exam period.
#' - __Project: 20%__ <br>
#'   You will work on a team project in which you solve a real problem involving
#'   real data and prepare a report including analyses, graphical displays and
#'   a careful interpretation of your analysis. The project has four components:
#'     1. A description of your plans including the data you plan to use and the
#'        general questions and methods of analysis you plan to use.
#'     2. An interim report on your progress submitted in mid-March, which your team
#'        will discuss with the instructor to get feedback.
#'     2. A '.R' or '.Rmd' script using Markdown that produces a detailed analysis and
#'        presentation of your work, including diagnostics, etc.
#'        This output can be quite detailed.
#'     3. A '.R' or '.Rmd' script using Markdown that produces an attractive and readable
#'        report with your main findings prepared in a way that would be suitable for
#'        a publication. You need to include all relevant references,
#'        data sources, etc. Aim for a maximum of 30 pages.
#'     4. Slides for a __10-minute__ presentation discussed below.
#'        The slides should be prepared with Rmarkdown using the ioslides format or
#'        other slide format.
#'        __You will collaborate using R, R Studio, R Markdown, git and github.__
#'     5. You will prepare a brief summary of your project for a 10-minute presentation in
#'        late March or early April. The 10-minute limit is strict. Be aware that it takes careful
#'        preparation and rehearsing to give a good presentation in such a short time.
#'        You must rehearse as a group ahead of time.
#'        The presentation will be followed by a 5-minute question and discussion period.
#'     -  The grade is based on the overall quality of the project (5%) and on
#'        your personal contribution to it (10%) and on your understanding of the
#'        issues and concepts in the project as shown in the final presentation
#'        and in project meetings with instructor. (5%).
#' - __Assignments: 15%__
#'     - Combination of individual and team assignments. Assigned approximately weekly or bi-weekly. 
#'       Most are done on Piazza. Some may involve contributions to Github R
#'       repositories.
#'     - Some assignments may have a higher weight than others.
#'     - All team members should feel responsible for helping each other to prepare and understand all solutions.
#'     - In most team assignments, different members of the team take the lead on
#'       preparing the answer to different questions. 
#'     - These team assignments are done in three steps. Usually, for an assignment given on Friday:
#'         - __Step 1:__ to be completed by __deadline #1__, usually the following __Thursday at noon__:
#'             - The team member reponsible for a question posts a tentative solution on Piazza before __deadline #1__. 
#'             - It must have a title of the form specified for the assignment.
#'             - The solution must start by __repeating the question__ so someone looking at the solution
#'               can tell what question it solves.
#'             - For math, use the LateX editor in Piazza. You can also make sketches on paper, photograph them and upload the
#'               photograph to Piazza. Use Rmarkdown as much as possible.
#'             - When you first submit the post, make it __private to your team__ and use the folder __assn X__, 
#'               where __X__ is the number
#'               of the assignment.  
#'             - Each post remains __private__ to your team until after __deadline #3__. 
#'             - You get full marks for effort in making an honest attempt, your answer does not have to be completely correct.
#'         - __Step 2:__ to be completed by all teammates by __deadline #2__, usually the following Saturday at noon:
#'             - Provide feedback on the solutions posted by your teammates: suggestions for improvements, improving coding in R, 
#'               pointing out inconsistencies or errors, broadening the
#'               answer to cover a broader range of cases, etc.
#'         - __Step 3:__ to be completed by __deadline #3__, usually the following Sunday at noon:
#'             - The team member responsible for a question reviews the suggestions made by teammates and incorporates them into
#'               the answer before __deadline #3__. Only __after deadline #3__ and __before the next class__, __make the solutions 
#'               public to the class__. 
#'         - I will select some solutions as interesting sample solutions and add them to the __star__ folder.  
#'           Being added to the star folder does not
#'           necessarily imply that a solution is correct, nor does it mean that it's the best solution. 
#'           It just means that I found some aspect of it
#'           interesting and illustrative of the issues presented in the question. 
#'           Conversely, not getting a star does not mean that you don't have an excellent solution. 
#'           Sometimes you can learn as much or more from a solution with 'errors' than from a perfect solution.
#' - __Class and Piazza contributions: 5%__ 
#'     - Contribute actively in class and make an original contribution at least __every two weeks__ on Piazza 
#'       (i.e. posting 7 items the last week doesn't count!):
#'          - participate on Zoom responding and asking question orally or through the chat window,
#'          - post or edit __questions__ and provide __answers__ about course material,
#'          - contribute to the course __wiki__: by posting your comments and/or links 
#'            to something on the web that is
#'            interesting and relevant to statistics. 
#'            Include your __summary and critique__ of the content and relevance.
#'            Use the __wiki__ folder for these posts.
#'          - Edit and improve existing __wiki__ posts.
#'          - At the end of the course, I may ask you to send me a post with links to your
#'            top 3 to 5 contributions.
#' - __Weekly feedback every Friday evening and quiz questions: 5%__<br> 
#'   Every Friday create a post that is private to the Instructors 
#'   (it may be made public later 
#'    during the weekend or you can make it public yourself) with information on each of the following:
#'   - What was the most interesting or challenging idea during the week?
#'   - What questions are you left with?
#'   - A quiz question based on the material of the week.
#'   - Be sure to choose the 'Feedback' folder when you post your feedback.
#' - If you miss or are late for a component of the course for a medical, compassionate or technical reason beyond your control, the weight of that
#'   portion of the requirements for the course will be transferred to the final examination. 
#'
#' # Prerequisites
#'
#' The prerequisites for taking this course are MATH 3330, MATH 3131 and MATH 4330. 
#' You must have passed **all** of these courses **before** taking MATH 4939. 
#' If you have deferred standing in one of these courses which you took in the
#' fall term of 2023, you may enrol in this course but you must have passed
#' all prerequisite courses to get credit for this course.
#' 
#' If you didn't take the prerequisite courses at York but are using courses
#' taken elsewhere to fulfill prerequisites, 
#' you must contact me, preferably 
#' with a private message through Piazza, to schedule an appointment
#' to test whether the material you have covered is an adequate equivalent.
#' You may be required to pass a short test on the prerequisite material.

#' # Getting Help
#'
#' - Post questions and comments about the course material
#'   on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/yorku.ca/winter2024/math4939). Post your
#'   questions to the entire class so everyone can benefit from the discussion
#'   and answer. The course's instructors will monitor
#'   Piazza and participate if other students don't have an answer.
#' - If you have a personal question for an instructor, you can post it on Piazza
#'   as a private posting. This should only be used for personal questions that are of
#'   no interest to the rest of the class.
#' - If you happen to post a private question whose answer is of general interest to the class,
#'   and it contains no personal information, We will assume that you consent to it being
#'   posted to the whole class unless you explicitly request otherwise. When such posts
#'   are posted to the whole class, the original author remains anonymous unless 
#'   you identify yourself in the post.
#' - You can ask your teammates or other classmates directly.
#' - You can ask instructors during tutorials, office hours, or after class.

#' # Some reflections on teams
#'
#' The project and many activities are done in
#' semi-randomly assigned teams that are assigned during
#' the first week of class.
#' 
#' One of the major focuses of most job interviews is your skill at
#' working in teams.
#' Working with a diverse team that you didn't select
#' yourself gives you the opportunity to have experiences
#' that will give you great anecdotes to use in your future
#' job interviews.
#' 
#' Many employers prefer applicants who will not only be productive themselves 
#' but also contribute to the creativity, imagination and productivity of
#' their colleagues and teams. 
#' 
#' Common interview questions stress responsibility and cooperation. 
#' They might go along the lines of:
#' 
#' - Tell us about a team project you worked on. 
#'   How did you help other team members achieve their potential?  
#'   What was your role and what did you contribute?
#' - Tell us about a time you had to work with a colleague
#'   who was difficult to get along with. 
#' - Tell us about a time your team didn't want to use your idea,
#'   what did you do and what was the outcome?
#' 
#' Interviewers are not looking for a 'right answer'.  They are giving you
#' a chance to show whether naturally think of helping others achieve their
#' potential, in addition to being highly competent yourself.
#' 
#' When you land the job, you will be much more likely to show
#' the kind of leadership and productivity in team work that is invaluable
#' in the workplace.
#'
#' Once teams are assigned, you will be able to
#' communicate directly with your team by posting messages directed to
#' your team on Piazza.
#'
#' The more work you do on an assignment the better prepared
#' you are to do well on the term test and on the final exam.
#' But you shouldn't hog the work -- let others do their part too.
#' Everyone should make sure that they understand the whole assignment.
#' Discuss the assignment with your team members to make sure everyone
#' understands the key points and difficulties of each question.
#'
#' # Course policies
#'
#' ## Missed deadlines 
#'
#' In general, late activities or projects will have their weight transferred
#' to the final exam.
#' 
#' ## Missed term test
#'
#' If you miss the term test, the weight of the test will
#' be transferred to the final exam.  
#'
#' <!--
#'  
#' ## Use of computers and cell phones in class
#'
#' You should bring your laptop to class
#' __to use it for purposes directly related to the class__
#' such as taking notes, annotating slides posted on the web
#' or trying out commands in R. Be aware that some pedagogical
#' research suggests that taking handwritten notes leads to deeper
#' learning for most students. I don't think that this is true for
#' all students and that is one reason why I would not consider
#' requiring students to forego the use of computers.
#'
#' It is natural to think that you do not affect anyone else
#' if you are doing your own thing
#' in class on your laptop, phone or tablet.
#' This is incorrect.
#' People seated around you cannot help but
#' be distracted. The instructor gets distracted when
#' members of the class are clearly lost in a different dimension.
#' Therefore, I request that you not use electronic devices 
#' for activities unrelated to the class
#' because this creates distractions for other
#' students and for me.
#'
#' -->
#' 
#' ## Academic honesty
#'
#' In **this course**, you are allowed to use aids like ChatGPT or other sources that
#' **may be forbidden in other courses.**  When you have used such sources, cite and **credit**
#' their answers in your answer, and include an analysis and critique of their
#' answers.  Much of the material of this course involves recognizing fallacies and paradoxes in
#' statistics and probability.  Fallacies are commonly-held but incorrect beliefs that ChatGPT probably shares.
#' In my experience, ChatGPT provides lengthy rambling answers that include excellent
#' insights along with serious errors and superficial irrelevant commentary.
#' Since you will be using these tools in your
#' future work, developing critical experience with them is valuable.
#' For that reason, you may use any source you wish in your work, **provided the material
#' and its source is cited and that you include your own critical analysis of the material.**  
#' 
#' **It is vital that you familiarize yourself with the policies of each course. 
#' If you are in doubt, ask the instructor.
#' In most courses, any use of ChatGPT or other similar sources is considered
#' a breach of academic honesty and may result in serious disciplinary consequences.**
#'   
#' Familiarize yourself with the
#' [York University Senate Policy on Academic Honesty](http://www.yorku.ca/univsec/policies/document.php?document=69).
#' Violations of academic honesty are treated very seriously in university.
#' 
#' __Always cite your sources__ for any information you use. This can as simple as
#' providing links to websites you have visited to get information. Doing so
#' enhances the value of your work.
