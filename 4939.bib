  abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  abstract = {P values linked to null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the most widely (mis)used method of statistical inference. Empirical data suggest that across the biomedical literature (1990–2015), when abstracts use P values 96\% of them have P values of 0.05 or less. The same percentage (96\%) applies for full-text articles. Among 100 articles in PubMed, 55 report P values, while only 4 present confidence intervals for all the reported effect sizes, none use Bayesian methods and none use false-discovery rate. Over 25 years (1990–2015), use of P values in abstracts has doubled for all PubMed, and tripled for meta-analyses, while for some types of designs such as randomized trials the majority of abstracts report P values. There is major selective reporting for P values. Abstracts tend to highlight most favorable P values and inferences use even further spin to reach exaggerated, unreliable conclusions. The availability of large-scale data on P values from many papers has allowed the development and applications of methods that try to detect and model selection biases, for example, p-hacking, that cause patterns of excess significance. Inferences need to be cautious as they depend on the assumptions made by these models and can be affected by the presence of other biases (e.g., confounding in observational studies). While much of the unreliability of past and present research is driven by small, underpowered studies, NHST with P values may be also particularly problematic in the era of overpowered big data. NHST and P values are optimal only in a minority of current research. Using a more stringent threshold, as in the recently proposed shift from P {$<$} 0.05 to P {$<$} 0.005, is a temporizing measure to contain the flood and death-by-significance. NHST and P values may be replaced in many fields by other, more fit-for-purpose, inferential methods. However, curtailing selection biases requires additional measures, beyond changes in inferential methods, and in particular reproducible research practices.},

However, categorical data can introduce unique issues in data wrangling, particularly in real-world settings with collaborators and periodically-updated dynamic data. This paper discusses common problems arising from categorical variable transformations in R, demonstrates the use of factors, and suggests approaches to address data wrangling challenges. For each problem, we present at least two strategies for management, one in base R and the other from the ‘tidyverse.’ We consider several motivating examples, suggest defensive coding strategies, and outline principles for data wrangling to help ensure data quality and sound analysis.},
