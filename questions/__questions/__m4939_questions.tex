  In order to assess factors related to reckless driving behaviors,
  investigators ran a study in which observers at different
  intersections with a stop sign recorded the number of cars that did
  not stop properly along with various information on each violator,
  including gender of the driver, type of car (sedan, sports utility,
  mini-van, wagon, truck, other), and approximate age of the driver
  (under 30, 30-40, 40-50, 50+). Pooling information from several
  intersections and for different observers, investigators recorded the
  number of violators in each category. \newline  Describe a generalized
  linear model for analyzing these data (specify a reasonable, possibly
  non-linear, model and its transformation to linear form as well as a
  conditional distribution and link function) and outline a specific
  approach for assessing the following questions of interest using
  frequentist methods: (1) is gender an important predictor? (2) is type
  of car an important predictor, and if so which types are predictive of
  a greater frequency of violations? (3) is there a trend with age in
  the frequency of violations? \vspace{0px}
\item
  In marketing research, it is widely believed that subliminal messages
  in advertisements can be effective in improving a consumer's
  impression of a product. To test whether the type and frequency of the
  subliminal message has an impact, investigators ran a study in which
  they enrolled male and female graduate students. Study subjects were
  all shown an outwardly-identical taped advertisement for a soft drink
  and then asked to rank their impression of the soft drink after
  watching the tape on a scale from 1-5 (1=strongly negative, 2=mildly
  negative, 3=no opinion, 4=mildly positive, 5=strongly positive). Tapes
  varied in the type of subliminal message (1=none, 2=attractive female
  face, 3=attractive male face) and (for tapes with a subliminal
  message) the frequency (1=low, 2=medium, 3=high). \newline Describe a
  regression model for relating gender, type of subliminal message, and
  frequency to an individual's impression. Describe the specifics of a
  Bayesian approach for addressing the following questions of interest
  to the investigator: (1) do subliminal messages have an effect
  overall? (2) does this effect vary depending on the gender of the
  observer? (3) does the effect depend on the frequency? and (4) do
  males and females respond differently depending on the type of
  subliminal message? Detail the prior used, the form of the regression
  model, and the likelihood. Provide an outline of the method used for
  posterior computation and inferences on the above questions of
  interest. \vspace{0px}
\item
  Suppose that a random variable \(Y\) has a Poisson distribution with
  mean \(\lambda\) were
  \(ln(\lambda) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2\). Assuming that
  \(X_2\) is not constant and that \(\beta_2 \ne 0\), show that \(Y\)
  does not have a Poisson distribution if one fits a model using only
  \(X_1\). \vspace{0px}
\item
  Uterine fibroids are a common reproductive tract tumor. To study
  factors related to fibroid incidence (that is, the rate of onset for
  women who do not have fibroids), women aged 20-30 who did not have
  fibroids at a baseline examination were enrolled in a prospective
  study. These women were then given a screening examination
  approximately every 5 years (though the specific ages at examination
  varied) to assess whether fibroids had yet developed. Each woman was
  followed for 15 years (3 examinations) or until she either developed
  fibroids or dropped out of the study. Various information was
  collected for each women, including race (white, black, other), age at
  menarche, age at entry into the study, age at each examination, and
  whether the woman was a smoker. \newline Assuming that fibroids do not
  go away once they have developed, describe a regression model for
  these data that allows fibroid incidence to vary with age and other
  factors. Show the observed data likelihood under this regression
  model, and develop a Bayesian approach for estimating age-specific
  fibroid incidence for women in different groups. Detail the prior used
  and the form of the posterior. Outline an approach for posterior
  computation and describe specifically how you obtain point and
  interval estimates for the probability of developing fibroids by a
  given age for women in different groups. \vspace{0px}
\item
  For adults who sailed on the Titanic on its fateful voyage, the odds
  ratio between gender (female, male) and survival (yes, no) was 11.4.
  What is wrong with the interpretation, ``The probability of survival
  for females was 11.4 times that for males.''

  identifying the parameter(s) for that distribution. Would it be

  There is a lab test for a rare disease D that has a specificity of .98
  and a sensitivity of .95. Suppose the prevalence of the disease is

  An article states that the PSA blood test for detecting prostate
  cancer stated that, of men who had this disease, the test fails to

  In the United States, data reported in 1993 indicates that the annual

  Consider the problem of imputing a grade for a missed mid-term mark
  from a student's performance on a final exam. Suppose a professor is
  considering three possibilities: 1) Use the student's z-score on the
  final exam to impute the z-score on the mid-term, 2) perform a linear
  regression of mid-term grades on the final exam grade and impute the
  mid-term grade by using the predicted mid-term grade, and 3) use a
  linear regression of the final exam grade on the mid-term grade and
  impute the mid-term grade that would have predicted the student's
  final exam grade. \newline Which of these three methods would be
  advantageous for a student who has a very high grade on the final
  exam? Which would be advantageous for a student who has a very low
  grade on the final exam? Clearly show the reasoning behind your
  answer. \vspace{0px}

  In the early stages of an epidemic, the number of new cases grows
  exponentially. Suppose that the expected number of cases on day
  \(t_i\) is modelled as \(\gamma e^{\delta t_i}\). Specify a GLM that
  you could use to analyze data in which the response is the number of
  new cases on a number of specific days, for example: days 5, 6, 10,
  12, 20 and 23. Describe in detail the transformation of the model to
  linear form and the interpretation of the original parameters above
  and of the linear parameters of the model. \vspace{0px}
\item
  Let \(Y\) be number of fatal accidents on a day in Toronto. Suppose
  the expected number of fatal car accidents depends on a number of
  variables and that, if all of these variables were taken into account,
  the conditional distribution of \(Y\) would be Poisson. Show that,
  assuming that the variables are not all constant, the unconditional
  distribution of \(Y\) itself is overdispersed relative to that of a
  Poisson distribution. \vspace{0px}
\item
  Give a real world example of three variables, \(X, Y,\) and \(Z\), for
  which we would expect \(X\) and \(Y\) to be marginally associated but
  conditionally independent controlling for \(Z\). \vspace{0px}
\item
  The~Cowles~data frame has 1421 rows and 4 columns. These data come
  from a study of the personality determinants of volunteering for
  psychological research. Neuroticism (neuro) is classified in three
  levels: low, medium and high. Extraversion (extra) is measured on a
  scale that ranges from 1 to 25. The purpose of the study is to explore
  some personality predictors of the willingness to volunteer and how
  the prediction differs between men and women. This is some output from
  an R script: \newline \includegraphics{m4330/q25a.PNG} \newline What
  is the predicted probability of volunteering for a male with high
  `neuro' and extraversion equal to 20? \vspace{0px}
\item
  \emph{(continued from previous question)} For each row of the
  following Anova table specify both the null hypothesis and the
  alternative hypothesis being tested. You may use R's linear model
  formulas to express the hypotheses or you may use the parameters of
  the model provided they are named in a way that is
  clear.\newline \includegraphics{m4330/q25b.PNG} \newline \vspace{0px}
\item
  \emph{(continued from previous question)} The following is an effect
  plot produced by the `effects' package.
  \newline \includegraphics{m4330/q25c.PNG} \newline  What are the main
  reasons that the confidence bands are wider for some combinations of
  neuro and sex than for others? \vspace{0px}
\item
  Sally Clark was convicted of murder of her two children who died with
  no signs of illness or trauma on the strength of statistical evidence
  that claimed that assuming the `null hypothesis' that she is innocent,
  the probability of 2 deaths occuring due to the only known
  explanation, sudden infant death syndrome, was extremely small. In
  testimony, Sir Roy Meadow claimed the probability to be 1 in 73
  million but better estimates would put it at a maximum of 1 in
  100,000.

  \par

  Explain whether 0.00001 can be considered a p-value for assessing the
  hypothesis that Sally Clark is innocent. Discuss whether there are
  other ways of assessing the probability of her guilt? Work out a rough
  calculation based on reasonable guesses for the result of such a
  calculation. \vspace{0px}
\item
  Discuss how it could be possible for a regression with two linear
  predictors to produce two different final models when using forward
  stepwise versus backward stepwise variable selection algorithms.
  Explain how a confidence region for the coefficients of the two linear
  predictors is related to forward and backward stepwise selection
  \vspace{0px}
\item
  A survey of students taking a large course showed (this is true) that
  students who viewed the recorded videos of the lectures many times
  performed less well on the final exam than students who viewed the
  videos fewer times. Upon discovering this study, your professor
  announces that they will discontinue recording the lectures because,
  the professor says, there is evidence that the videos cause students
  to do perform more poorly on courses. Comment on the professor's
  reasoning using concepts we have studied in this course. \vspace{0px}
\item
  Choose a possible confounding factor and use a Paik-Agresti diagram to
  show how controlling for this confounding factor could reverse the
  direction of association between the frequency of video viewing and
  performance on the course. \vspace{0px}

  Discuss whether you should use the aggregate (marginal) or the
  segregated (conditional) data to attempt to determine the true effect
  in the following situation: There are two treatments used on kidney
  stones: Treatment A and Treatment B. Doctors are more likely to use
  Treatment A on large (and therefore, more severe) stones and more
  likely to use Treatment B on small stones. Should a patient who
  doesn't know the size of his or her stone examine the general
  population data, or the stone size-specific data when determining
  which treatment will be more effective? Why? Draw a Paik diagram if it
  helps to make your point more clearly. \vspace{0px}
\item
  Discuss whether you should use the aggregate (marginal) or the
  segregated (conditional) data to attempt to determine the true effect
  in the following situation: There are two doctors in a small town.
  Each has performed 100 surgeries in his career, which are of two
  types: one very difficult surgery and one very easy surgery. The first
  doctor performs the easy surgery much more often than the difficult
  surgery and the second doctor performs the difficult surgery more
  often than the easy surgery. You need surgery, but you do not know
  whether your case is easy or difficult. Should you consult the success
  rate of each doctor over all cases, or should you consult their
  success rates for the easy and difficult cases separately, to maximize
  the chance of a successful surgery? Why? \vspace{0px}
\item
  Discuss whether you should use the aggregate (marginal) or the
  segregated (conditional) data to attempt to determine the true effect
  in the following situation: In a study of a group of male 50 to
  55-year-old long-time smokers, researchers compared a group of heavy
  smokers with matched group (same age range, sex and similar
  socioeconomic and environmental backgrounds) of light smokers. It was
  found that lung function was worse in the group of heavy smokers than
  in the group of light smokers. The researchers also measured the
  amount of tar deposit in the lungs of the subjects and classified
  subjects as having heavy or light tar deposits. Would you get a better
  indication of the effect of smoking by comparing the aggregated data
  for the two groups or by comparing the tar level specific data? Why?

  Here are some fictitious data on the rate of complications for
  appendectomies performed at University Hospital, a large urban
  teaching and research hospital, and in County Hospital, a small-town
  hospital: at University Hospital there were 800 cases with 100
  (12.5\%) resulting in complication and at County Hospital there were
  200 cases resulting in 5 (10\%) complications. The p-value for a test
  of the hypothesis that there is no difference in the rate at the two
  hospitals is 0.0037. Suppose that appendectomies can be classified as
  high risk or low risk and that the high risk cases tend to be directed
  disproportionately to University Hospital instead of County Hospital.
  Construct two hypothetical tables, one for each level of risk, and
  draw a Paik diagram that shows how it is possible for both high- and
  low-risk patients to have a lower probability of complications at
  University Hospital than at County Hospital, although, overall the
  probability of complications is higher at University Hospital than at
  County Hospital. \vspace{0px}

  A study investigated whether there was a higher risk of complications
  when women gave birth at home with the assistance of a midwife instead
  of giving birth in a maternity ward in a hospital. Of 400 women who
  chose to give birth at home 20 had complications and of 2,000 women
  who gave birth in a hospital 200 had complications. Do you think that
  this is an experimental study or an observational study? Why?
  \vspace{0px}
\item
  (continued from the previous question) The data suggest that it is
  safer (in the sense of a lower rate of complications) to give birth at
  home than to give birth in the hospital. Discuss whether this implies
  that a woman should consider giving birth at home in order to reduce
  her risk of complications. Identify at least one plausible confounding
  factor and one plausible mediating factor that could partly explain
  the results of the study \vspace{0px}
\item
  (continued from the previous question) Choose a possible confounding
  factor and use a Paik diagram to show how controlling for this
  confounding factor could reverse the direction of association between
  the rate of complications and the location of birth: home or hospital.
